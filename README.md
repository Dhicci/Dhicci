### About me
Hi, I'm Taavi. I'm based in Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia.<br></br>
I'm currenly studying for a bachelor's degree in Practical Informatics at Haapsalu College on the weekends.
As a **Game Developer/Programmer** with a keen mind for the technical side of things, I'm passionate about learning new things in the field of game development.
The majority of my game development experience has unfolded within Unity, a platform I began working with in 2013. Additionally, I've also acquired proficiency in utilizing both Godot and Unreal engines.
